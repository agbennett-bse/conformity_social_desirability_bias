## Project Description
This paper investigates the impact of social conformity bias on perceptions of gender equality within the academic environment. We used Nudge Theory by implementing a conformity trigger on our survey participants and also implemented a veiled vs unveiled scenario for survey participants. We concluded that SDB does exist in gender bias and SDB is also excacerbated by a conformity trigger.
